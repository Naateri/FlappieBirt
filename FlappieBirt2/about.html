			<h1> How was Flappie Birt born? </h1>
			<p> Part of their Platform Based Development university course, two students (whom you can find on github using the link below) from <a href="http://ucsp.edu.pe/"> Universidad Católica San Pablo </a> remembered how much fun they had playing the original Flappy Bird over 3 years ago, and were a little pissed on how it was taken off of the internet. They even have the original app installed on their respective devices. So they wondered, why not make a remasterization of that game they enjoyed playing, but adding more things to make it more interesting, and present it as their final project? That's how this project started. Due by the first week of July, the pair of teenagers are already working on this, not only for their grade, but also so people can have fun and remember this interesting and at the same time really stressing game. </p> 

			<h1> Who are the creators? </h1>
			<p> <a href="http://github.com/rdalejandro22">Alejandro Risco</a> and <a href="http://github.com/Naateri">Renato Postigo</a> are both students from the <a href="http://cs.ucsp.edu.pe/"> Computer Science School </a> at Universidad Católica San Pablo <a href="http://ucsp.edu.pe/">(UCSP)</a>, currently coursing their third semester. As said above, this app will be presented as their final project for their Platform Based Development course. Both students, and friends, liked the idea to present a remasterization of Flappy Bird (with another name to avoid copyright issues) but with a challenge to it: adding more features (more information can be found at our <a href="unlockables.html">unlockables</a> section). As of right now, the project is still in the process of being made, but will be finished within a few weeks. We both hope you like the final product, and that you will enjoy it a lot (and maybe get a little bit stressed... we do not condone the destroying of mobile devices).</p>
